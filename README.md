<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/CodyS"><img src="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/CodyS/git-tutorial.svg" alt="Certificate of Completion for Learn Enough Git"></a>


This badge shows that I have completed an online course called [Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/course/learn_enough_git/). If you want to see some of my work, checkout [My Professional Portfolio](https://yellowyam.github.io/professional-portfolio/). As a web developer, I purpose to build applications to improve information availability and audit within my workplace community; however, I'm available to collaborate on any web development task. Send me a message!

I'd like to credit [GA Tech Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/coding/) with helping me learn the ropes of full-stack web development and with putting my feet on the path to success in this endeavor.
